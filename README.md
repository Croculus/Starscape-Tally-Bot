# Starscape-Tally-Bot

This project is a discord bot I worked on to gather, sort, and publish user kill data automatically for a small game called Starscape on Roblox. I worked on it here and there from late 2021 to mid 2022. It was my first real project that I was going to share, but school and other responsibilities stopped me from finishing before I was burnt out. 

I've decided to publish my code here to reflect upon in the future and get feedback on what I can improve on. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.

NOTE: This bot is meant to work with a sql database. The main version is prepped to be hosted on Heroku, however I have created a local version that requires a local postgres DB to be installed.
